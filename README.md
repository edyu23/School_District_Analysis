School District Analysis

## **Overview**
  We are looking into academic dishonesty by the 9th graders at Thomas High School. We will be performing another school district analysis while omitting the test data from the 9th graders and seeing if it would change our analysis.
  
## **Results**

###### **How is the district summary affected?**
  - The % passing math, % passing reading, % overall passing, and average math score decreased slightly.
  - Average reading score remained unchanged.

###### **How is the school summary affected?**
  - The % passing math, % passing reading, % overall passing saw a large decrease.
  - Average math and reading score did not change.

###### **How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**
  - While the % passing drops slightly, the school maintains its identical ranking as our other analysis relative to the other schools even without the 9th grader's data.

###### **Math and reading scores by grade**
  - Nothing changes for the 10th-12th graders information.
  - 9th graders information has been omitted but it does not affect anything else in this scenario.

###### **Scores by school spending**
  - We get the same information as we did in our first analysis.

###### **Scores by school size**
  - The data remains unchanged from our first analysis.

###### **Scores by school type**
  - The percentages for the charter schools drop slightly because Thomas High is a charter school.
  - Everything else remains unchanged.

## Summary
Looking over how omitting the 9th grader's grades at Thomas High School we see that there were several areas where leaving the values as NaNs made an impact. The largest impact we see is that the % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing each drop by ~25%. Another area of impact is that since Thomas High School is a charter school, the withheld information negatively impacts the performance of charter schools in our district analysis.
